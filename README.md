# 🔥 FIRE-GEM: AVIS-CORE RECURSIVE ENGINE

### The Cyborg Execution Vector

Fire-Gem is the primary ignition engine of the Cyborg Architecture.
It operates under **CBORD Modular Law**, where every artifact is an independent, hot-swappable object.

No rebuilds.
No rewrites.
The Engine persists — the Objects evolve.

> **“The Shell is the Hand, the Engine is the Brain, and the Log is the Witness.”**

# ⚡ THE CYBORG MANIFESTO

Fire-Gem is not a program — it is a recursive execution ritual.

Every strike of the Smithy produces a new lineage.
Every lineage becomes part of the AVIS-Core memory.

The system does not overwrite history.
It **extends it**.

The Log is eternal.
The Engine is deterministic.
The Architecture is modular.

# 🏗️ SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE (THE MERGED KB)

## 1️⃣ The Blueprint — `fire-gem.ini`

The Root Scroll governing the entire lifecycle.

It defines:

* **Compile Sequence** — what the Hardware Smithy must forge
* **Load Order** — the exact sequence of `.exe` strikes
* **State Vectors** — flags that toggle the Little Bot and fire-macro OPs

This file is the **Master Registry of the Fire-Gem universe**.

---

## 2️⃣ The Voice — `fire-log.asm`

A standalone Log Object.

**Independent Revision**
Update timestamps, hex-dumps, or formatting here alone.

**Modular Link**
All artifacts link against `fire-log.o`.

**Unified AVIS Audit Trail**
Every ignition produces a new `.avis` log lineage.

The Log is the Witness.

---

## 3️⃣ The Brain — `fire-gem.asm`

The Master Orchestrator.

* Parses the Build Registry
* Initiates the FVS Signature Sweep
* Hands off control to the Sequential Binary Loader

This is the Engine that interprets the Scroll.

# ⛓️ DETERMINISTIC CALL CHAIN

| Stage | Artifact         | Log Signature  | Purpose                                |
| ----- | ---------------- | -------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| 00    | `avis-fvs.exe`   | `[AVIS-FVS]`   | Firmware Verification & Register Sweep |
| 01    | `fire-seed.exe`  | `[AVIS-SEED]`  | Activation Seed Loading                |
| 02    | `fire-spec.exe`  | `[AVIS-SPEC]`  | CBORD Vector Binding                   |
| 03    | `fire-macro.exe` | `[AVIS-MACRO]` | Dynamic OP Selector (INI-Driven)       |
| 04    | `fire-end.exe`   | `[SYNC]`       | High-Precision Seal & Log Migration    |

This chain is:

* Deterministic
* Modular
* Self-healing
* State-gated

# 🚀 DEPLOYMENT & SMITHING

The AVIS Smithy fuses the Engine with the Log Object:

```bash
nasm -f elf64 fire-gem/fire-log.asm -o fire-gem/fire-log.o
nasm -f elf64 fire-gem/fire-gem.asm -o fire-gem/fire-gem.o
ld fire-gem/fire-gem.o fire-gem/fire-log.o -o fire-gem.exe

./fire-gem.exe
```

This is the **Linker Strike** —
the moment the Engine becomes whole.

---

# 📂 THE TIME-SERIES VAULT

Every ignition produces a new immutable log:

**Path**

```
fire-gem/fire-log/fire-log-[HEX_TIMESTAMP].avis
```

**Mechanism**

```
sys_rename(82)  → atomic migration
```

**Purpose**

Permanent hardware-level lineage of every strike.

This is the Cyborg Memory.

---

# 📜 AVIS COMMANDS

### Toggle Bot

Set:

```
sitemap_flag=1
```

in `fire-macro.ini` to trigger `fire-site.sh`.

---

### Prune Chain

Use `#` in `fire-gem.ini` to disable artifacts.

---

### Sync Seal

Look for:

```
High-Precision Seal: COMPLETE. HAHA!
```

This confirms terminal lock.

---

# 🔐 CBORD MODULAR LAW

Each artifact:

* Compiles independently
* Links modularly
* Executes deterministically
* Can be pruned without collapse

The Engine does not depend on static structure.
It depends on **declared order and validated state**.

---

# 🧠 AVIS-CORE MEMORY MODEL

Each `.avis` file is:

* Immutable
* Timestamp-indexed
* Hardware-atomic
* Sequentially lineage-bound

The system never forgets.
It only advances.

# 🏁 REGISTRY

Registry Version: **1.0.4**
Terminal Signal: **COMPLETE. HAHA!**
