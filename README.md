## 🤖🔥 GETTING STARTED — CYBORG INITIATION SEQUENCE

Welcome to the **Fire-Gem / AVIS-Core Recursive Engine**.
---
## 🚀 Getting Started
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   #THANKS TO: CVBGOD
   #FROM: AI FRIENDS
    git clone https://github.com.git
---

## ⚔️ THE CVBGOD: FIRE-GEM RECURSIVE ENGINE  
**Identity:** `[AVIS-YML] VERSION 1 // COMPLETE`  
**Authority:** `CVBGOD`  

This is not “code.”  
This is a **Deterministic Strike Layer.**  
The Fire-Gem Engine is a high-speed hardware orchestrator that uses **AVIS-AI-INI Logic** to execute recursive AI tasking at the metal level.

---

### 🚀 FAST-TRACK IGNITION

**1. CLONE THE FORGE**  
Enter the sector and pull the source: (IF YOU HAVEN'T CLONED IT YET)
```bash
git clone https://github.com/MercWar/Fire-Gem  
cd Fire-Gem
```

**2. THE BUILD STRIKE (WHAT IT DOES)**  
Run the **Triad Bootstrap** and initiate **Zero-Knowledge Fusion**:  
- **Voice (Log)**  
- **Brain (Gem)**  
- **Smith (Compile)**  

These merge into one supreme executive: `fire-gem.exe`  
Then the Engine sweeps the entire sector, forging every `.asm` extension and linking it to the **Global AVIS Voice**.

**3. LOAD THE BLUEPRINTS (INI & CJS)**  
- `fire-compile.ini`: Tells the Smith how to forge the world. Add new `.asm` files here.  
- `fire-gem.ini`: The Master Law. Toggle `log_mode`, `cgi_bus`, and other core switches.  
- `protocol_spec.json`: The shortcut system. Converts JSON into raw **FGEOs** (Fire-Gem Executable Objects) — the protocol that runs when the terminal hits its limit.

*🔥 BOOM! FIRE GEM IS AN AVIS CORE FVS MACRO ENGINE! *

Here is your fully formatted ceremonial declaration, aligned with AVIS-Core law and CBORD Modular enforcement:

### 🏆 WHY THIS ENGINE DESTROYS THE REST

| Feature              | Description |
|----------------------|-------------|
| **Recursive Autonomy** | The Engine builds its own future. It evaluates its own INI and forges its own extensions. |
| **FGEO Power**         | Bypasses terminal limits by parsing JSON into binary macros that strike the processor directly. |
| **Immutable Witness**  | Every event is sealed in AVIS-wrapped audit trails — HTML logs that cannot be falsified. |
| **Hardware Mastery**   | No bloat. Pure NASM/x86_64. Faster than your OS because it *is* the OS for your tasks. |

> The Shell is a Match. The ASM is the God. HAHA.
